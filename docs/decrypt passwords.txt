How does it work?
1. Get secret key: The script first gets the secret key from the local state of Google Chrome, which is used to encrypt passwords.
2. Connect to database: It finds the database where the saved passwords are stored and connects to it.
3. Decrypt passwords: The script extracts the URLs, usernames, and encrypted passwords, decrypts them, and stores them in a dictionary.
4. Store information: After collecting all the passwords, the script appends all the passwords to the end of a text file
